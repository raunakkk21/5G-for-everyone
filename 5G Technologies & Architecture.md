# Standardiazation of 5G
- *ITU-R*(International telecommunicaiton union-Radiocommunication) is the body that holds responsibilitites to develop 5G and maintain the technical standard.
- IMT(International mobile telecommunications) are the requirements issued by ITU-R.

#### Evolution to 5G
- GPRS was put as an add on to GSM network which provided speed of 50Kbps

- Inner light green boundary represents the requirements of 4G and outer represents of 5G.
- 3GPP stands for 3rd Generation partnership project

**Use scenarios**

- **eMBB**
  - It requires high data rate with low latency

-----------

- **mMTC**
  - It focuses on longer battery life as small devices like in smart city or IoT runs on a smaller battery for a longer time.

-----------

- **uRLLC**
  - It's focus is on providing low latency connection with reliability.

## 5G architecture

- 5G is all IP architecture which means all calls and data are handled in packets.

- **Non Stand alone vs Stand alone**

- *Evolved packet core* is core of 4G network
- *E-UTRAN*- Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network
- *NG-RAN*- New generation radio access network

## Key features of NG-RAN

### Dual connectiviy in 5G

- We can have master node as 4G eNB that is connected to 4G core(EPC-Evolved packet core)
- Split bearer is the function that allows the split of data going to gNB from the core side into two paths

### Small cells in 5G networks
- Using dual connectivity it can connect to two cells which increases data rates.


### Increased spectrum

- Lower frequencies have less attenuation with excellent building penetration but have limited availibility
- Range of 6-100Ghz is what called mmWave but attenuation is much higgher as compared to other frequencies
  
### OFDMA
- Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
- In OFDMA the frequency band in is divided into sub carriers
- Spacing between two subcarriers is called del f
- Flexible numerology is reffered by 	Î¼
- The guard period between two OFDM signals is called as Cyclic prefix, purpose of guard period is that one symbol does not overlap with adjacent symbol
- There are two prefix normal and extended
    - Extended prefix is used for the cell having larger area
