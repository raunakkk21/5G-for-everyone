# Standardiazation of 5G
- *ITU-R*(International telecommunicaiton union-Radiocommunication) is the body that holds responsibilitites to develop 5G and maintain the technical standard.
- IMT(International mobile telecommunications) are the requirements issued by ITU-R.

#### Evolution to 5G
- GPRS was put as an add on to GSM network which provided speed of 50Kbps

- Inner light green boundary represents the requirements of 4G and outer represents of 5G.
- 3GPP stands for 3rd Generation partnership project

**Use scenarios**

- **eMBB**
  - It requires high data rate with low latency

- 5G is all IP architecture which means all calls and data are handled in packets.

- **Non Stand alone vs Stand alone**

- *Evolved packet core* is core of 4G network
- *E-UTRAN*- Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network
- *NG-RAN*- New generation radio access network

- We can have master node as 4G eNB that is connected to 4G core(EPC-Evolved packet core)
- Split bearer is the function that allows the split of data going to gNB from the core side into two paths

### Small cells in 5G networks
- Using dual connectivity it can connect to two cells which increases data rates.


### Increased spectrum

- Lower frequencies have less attenuation with excellent building penetration but have limited availibility
- Range of 6-100Ghz is what called mmWave but attenuation is much higgher as compared to other frequencies
  
### OFDMA
- Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
- In OFDMA the frequency band in is divided into sub carriers
- Spacing between two subcarriers is called del f
- Flexible numerology is reffered by 	Î¼
- The guard period between two OFDM signals is called as Cyclic prefix, purpose of guard period is that one symbol does not overlap with adjacent symbol
- There are two prefix normal and extended
    - Extended prefix is used for the cell having larger area

### Resource Block
- In 5G NR resource block is only defined in frequency domain and not in time domain having 12 consecutive block vertically
- In case of LTE resource block was defined in both frequency and time domains.
- As the spacing of sub carriers increased the duration of time slot is increased.

### Resource element
- It is defined in both time and frequency domain

### Modulation in 5G
- *QAM*- Quadrature amplitude modulation
- When the distance between UE and tower increases and if there are obstacles between them, we need to downgrade the modulation scheme.
- For example
   - 16 QAM= 4 bits per symbol
   - 256 QAM= 8 bits per symbol, i.e it is defined in the power of 2

- Each antenna is transmitting signals at a speed of 10Mb per second
- In single user mimo there are four antennas at transmitter and four at receiver, also calle 4*4 order
- In multi user mimo there are 2 antennas each at transmitter and receiver

- Access stratum signaling is that signaling which is going on between user equipment and gNB
- Non access stratum signaling is that signaling which happens between UE and core network
- Radio resource managmement- gNB has to decide that what resource blocks are being allocated to these UE in order to satisfy their demands in terms of quality and service
<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-13 231655" src="https://github.com/raunakkk21/Everything-about-5G/assets/143111163/1d554002-27ff-49e5-b162-666ab4011a8e">

### PDU(Protocol data unit) sessions

- In order to provide services, network need to establish PDU session with UE's
- Each PDu session may contain one or more QoS

### Control and User plane

## AMF(Access and mobility  managment function)
<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-13 233806" src="https://github.com/raunakkk21/Everything-about-5G/assets/143111163/8e3df5a9-a4c4-4ccc-ad8d-4872047b5313">

- AMF is resposible for registering the UE to the network.
- When a UE moves from one TA(tracking area) to other then then tracking area number needs to be updated in the core network which is handled by AMF


### Authentication Server Funtion(AUSF)
- Whenever UE wants to register itself to a network or make a call, it is done by AUSF
- Whenever AMF inititaes the authentication process it sends the identity of UE to AUSF .
- AUSF requests UDM to generate the authentication vector which is generated by a secret key

### UPF(User Plane Function)
- When a UE moves it may go from coverage area of one tower to another but it  would always be have PDU session established with UPF

### UDM(Unified Data management)
- It is the centralised database for all the subsciber in 5G network
- UDM can have internal data base, built in , or it can use external database like UDR
