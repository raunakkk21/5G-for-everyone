## Radio Signal properties
- Travels with speed of light
- RF range-3KHz-300GHz
- Frequency-no of repititon of radio signals in 1 second.
- Wavelength-distance a radio signal travels during one complete cycle
- Frequency=speed of light/wavelength
- Radio wave has 1500 times more wavelenth than radiowave

## Carrier waves and modulation
- Information sent by carreir waves can be analaog or digital.
- Radio frequency signals are referred as carreier waves.
  
1.*Modulation*- process whcih we impress information onto carrier wave for transmission which changes certain attributes such as wavelength and frequency.  

2.*Demodulation*- process to extract or recover information at receiver end.

3.*Modem*- "Mo" stands for modulation and "dem" stands for demodulation of waves.  


## Wireless transmission and reception
<img width="700" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-02 171950" src="https://github.com/raunakkk21/5G-for-everyone/assets/143111163/cefeff2a-5d31-4c74-83fc-6312aca8897c">   

- Cell toweres or base stations are deployed to carry wireless signals over large distances.
- Higher frequency leads to high path loss.
- *Attenuation*- loss of sinal power during transmission.
- *Interference*-When two or more waves meet while traveling through the same medium and leads to loss of signal or degrade its quality.

## Noise and Interference
  <img width="700" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-02 172510" src="https://github.com/raunakkk21/5G-for-everyone/assets/143111163/4cecdbab-54a5-46b7-9ea5-cf7a8a322db2">   
  
- Unwanted energy or singals
- *Ambient noise* - always present in any device  or gnereated within a device.
- When two nearby transmitters use same radio frequency at same time they create interference but it can be mitigated using some practices.
- High noise and interference leads to loss of signals  
1.**SNR**-Signal to noise ratio
  
2.**SINR*- Signal to noise and interference ratio   


## Radio Spectrum  
- Range of frequencies over which wireless communication takes place for specific purpose.
- For mobile phones- 450MHz - 39GHz for 5G, whereas in 4G it is upto 2.6 GHz
